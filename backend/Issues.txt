FRONTEND DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- currently each event can accept more than the maximum number of participants specified on creation
    - i.e. 3 responses when participants = 2

BACKEND LOGIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- currently the only times being checked are the start and end times
    - i.e. instead of check all times between start and end that can hold the meeting
- available times doesn't account for the date that the times are available
